# 1D Barcode Detection
Detect barcode in the image or via web camera. Use image processing techniques. 

## Description
An input image is preprocessed according to the methodology listed below:
1) Grayscale image
2) Gradient calculation using Sobel filter
3) Gaussian blur (9x9 kernel)
4) Binary threshold at 220 intensity
5) Morphology using 21x7 kernel as structuring element
6) Series of erosion and dilation.

In the next step, the biggest rectangle countour is found using <b>findcontours()</b> from OpenCV library. 

Only one barcode in the image is recommended.

## Setup 
To run this project on <b> Linux</b> type in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AleksandraPestka/Barcode-detection-1D.git
```
Use the package manager <b>pip</b> to install requirements (virtualenv recommended)
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install --upgrade setuptools
```
Move to script folder
```bash
$ cd scripts
```
Run project using your locally saved images: <br>

```bash
$ python main.py -m Locally -d DATA_DIRECTORY -s SAVE_DIRECTORY
```
DATA_DIRECTORY: path to folder which contains your images; one can use provided dataset in: <i>"../data/Barcode/passed/"</i> 
<br>SAVE_DIRECTORY (optionally): path to folder to save processed images; one can use: <i> "../results/" </i>


Or run project in real-time using web camera
```bash 
$ python main.py -m Real-time
```
## Difficulties
The algorithm is quite straightforward and based on image processing techniques, thus as a consequence it is not sufficiently robust to:
- blurry images<br>
<img src="results/failed3.jpg" width=200>
- images with many barcodes<br>
<img src="results/failed1.jpg" width=200>
- images with granulated structure<br>
<img src="results/failed2.jpg" width=200>
- images with a lot of text (no zoom in on barcode) <br>
<img src="results/failed4.jpg" width=200>

One of the ideas of improving algorithm's performance is to combine it with machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network.
Thanks to that, it would be general-purpose and robust to constraints described above. Moreover, the most desired feature would be also decoding the barcode. One of the libraries which provide such function is for example <i>pyzbar.</i>
